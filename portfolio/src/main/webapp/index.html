            <h1>Getting to know me.</h1>
            <p>My name is Michael Stone and I am a first generation college student. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's in 
            Computer Engineering at Columbia Univserity. My curiosity tends to be my driving force in my day to day life, and
            without it I would find myself very bored.
            </p>

        <div class="aboutMePiece" id="studying">

            <h1>My field of study</h1>
            <p>Those who know me know I love to tinker with things. I just have a natural urge to take things apart and put them
                back together. For better or for worse, at times I even try "upgrading" the items I take apart which
                either works.... or... ends up breaking said item... Regradless there is no better field for me than engineering.
                I am an aspiring computer engineer. My major tends to get mixed up with computer science a lot but I assure you
                they are different majors. In computer engineering, I learn everything a computer scientist does; data structures,
                advanced algorithms, networks, AI, you name it. The key difference being computer engineers also learn the 
                electrical engineering that comes with a computer. Now you are wondering "how do they learn everything a computer
                science person does with electrical engineering"? The answer is quite simple actually. We basically stuff our
                schedules to the brim. Me in particular I am very interested in systems engineering. Systems engineering is the
                magical world where hardware and software come together to make amazing things happen. Basically, the world
                where electricity meets code. If all goes according to plan I would like to one day pursue a masters degress
                in a related field in systems engineering.

        <div class="aboutMePiece" id="goals">
        
            <h1>Dreams and aspirations</h1>
            <p>Depending on the context I have a variety of goals that I hope to reach at some point in my life.
                Some goals I have set since I was a young child and others have been set relativly recent. I believe that
                "goals" are a continous list you never stop adding to, they are essentially like checkpoints in your life
                to access how far you made it. Regardless one of my most important and personal goals comes from my childhood.
                The goal was "I want to make it". Now, I admit this sounds a little cliched, ofcourse, everyone wants to make it.
                For me it is a little bit more than that. I have went through a lot since I was a young child. To put it in
                sweet and simple terms, I never really got to experience any part of my child hood and most of my teen years.
                I always felt like I was always overcoming one wave of problems just to be greated with an even bigger one.
                I saw many people succumb to their enviornments or to negative influences and I more than anything wanted to 
                make it. A dream that I set when I probably was in elementary school is soon going to be realized in a year
                when I finally graduate. As for some of my other goals, I want to work at a space company because ever
                since I was a child space had always captivated me. I also would love to be a mentor for those who come from 
                less fortunate backgrounds as I have and hopefully inspire others to keep pushing to become something greater
                than their past.

            <h1>Hobbies</h1>

            <p>I am simple guy. With Simple Taste. I enjoy gaming, as a matter of fact I am used to be a hardcore gamer
                until I had to be responsible and stuff. I like being active and working out. This can include anything
                from pumping iron to going on a hike. I love spending time on YouTube and Twitch, it is actually my go to
                activity when I am going into lazy mode. Being a mentor and teaching is fun, espically when I am teaching things
                I personally find interesting. Working on projects is also something I spend a lot of time on. If it is something
                I enjoy building then I will easily spend weeks doing it non-stop. This sort of behavior has at times labeled me
                as a workaholic.

                This course focuses on  analysis of linear circuits and their applications. Formulation of circuit equations. 
                Network theorems. Transient response of first and second order circuits. Sinusoidal steady state analysis.

            <h1>Operating Systems</h1>

            <p>Class attended Spring 2020. Easily one of the hardest classes I have ever taken. The class focused on
                hacking the Debian Linux OS. In order to do that we had to learn in depth how diffferent parts of the OS
                worked together. We learned about schedulers, task-structs, synchronis and asynchronis programming,
                and implementing system calls just to name a few. The class had a "self exploration mind set", where we learned
                about concepts and theories and class and then had to dive into linux documentation on our own to find out
                "how to build and implement another scheduler"? Or how to add another file-system into our OS?
            </p>

            <p>projects worth bragging about (C): 
                Building a multi-server that can handle HTTP protocol.
                Building an OS scheduler called freezer.
                Implementing an OS wide system call called fridge which was basically a gloabl hash table
                Implementing a custom file-system

            <h1>Computer Networks</h1>

            <p>Class attneded Spring 2020. A class that talked about the different layers of the internet and about
                the differen algorithms and protocols that exist between the application and data link layers.
                Discussing things such as the TCP protocol for handling packet loss or how datagrams are built in the transport
                layer and passed down to the network layer.
            </p>

            <p> projects worth bragging about (Python):

                Bulding a cache server that handled HTTP requests. After every query the results were cached in local directory for quick future access
                Built a traceroute algorithm that returned RTT value for each router hit from local host to destination server.

            <p>Class attended Fall 2019. Learned about advanced algorithms and low level implications of Stack and Heap.
                Learned the ins and outs of the C langauge, building everything from back end databases to full on servers
                from scratch using C.
            </p>

            <p>projects worth bragging about (C)

                Built a server that was able to handle client HTTP requests. Client would request a website and server 
                would return site with expected HTTP response. Server also connected to back end database that 
                can display information using html format.

                Recreated the weget functionality in terminal to allow users to download site and file contents.
                This was done by using a TCP socket connection and understanding Standard I/O in C and UNIX enviorments.

                they invidivual components to create more complicated componnets in a computer. Learned about MIPS programming
                and how the pipe architecture works. Specifically how does adding new components or new commands affect the
